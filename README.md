# 42rent
4 people looking 2 Rent

I'm looking to create a possibly international website for renting (appartments at first)
It will be possible to localize it to a certain country and have the whole site function for that country only.
It should have a sleek and simple UI.
It will have smart filtering options.

"Things 4 Rent 2 people"

On logout: "So long, and thanks for all the fish"
"Don't panic"
"Mostly Harmless"
"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"
"And Another Thing"
"Life, the Universe and Everything"
